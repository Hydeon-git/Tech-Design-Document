# Tech Design Document
# Introduction
This is a webpage created for hosting a research I did about Tech Design Document for the subject Project II while I was coursing my Degree in Game Desing & Development in CITM-UPC.

In this website we will see why big companies use the TDD and how they create it. We will cover and explain every section carefully.

## What's a Technical Design Document?
The Technical Design Document (TDD) is an essential piece that goes hand by hand with the Game Design Document (GDD) and the Art Bible.
The TDD should be located on an internal website and has to be updated constantly throughout  the project realization. In our case, in a GitHub Wiki.

While the GDD is giving a detailed explanation of the idea that will be in the game the TDD takes those ideas and provides all  the required technical information for that idea in order to work on the game as the GDD expects.
GDD and TDD work together all the time for the sake of implementing all the aspects of the game as the developer team desires.

We were saying that the TDD and the GDD work together, but what are differences between them?  Let’s dig in on this detailed explanation.
The GDD is the core of all the documents. It includes everything that comes from the concepts and the ideas.
On the other hand the TDD provides a blueprint for the engineers working on the code. It includes everything related to the tools and technology required to develop the game.

Now, let’s take a look at this Valheim gif!
We can see that there’s fog in the environment, we can different effects in screen and there’s a UI too.

This aspects of the game are in both documents:
The GDD contains the concept and the idea.
The TDD contains the technical data to make it real.
